    "#### Programming as a Writing Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is like writing a descriptive essay -- you are telling the computer exactly what you want it to do.  Each step must be explained in some detail, and there must be a logical flow from one step to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the audience of your program is a machine (i.e., a computer), you must be clear and precise.  A machine is very limited in what it can understand.  Furthermore, you must communicate by using a language that the machine can understand.  For this workshop, the language that we will use is Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a language, Python has a syntax and a grammar.  Unlike most natural lnaguages, it has very strict rules for following the syntax.  Again, the strict rules are there to ensure that we are precise in what we want the computer to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Python means that you must learn the rules of the language and how to translate your thoughts into that language.  Often, the translation of thoughts is the most difficult step!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an _interpretive_ language.  The computer will _interpret_ each statement, and follow the instructions required by that statement, before moving on to the next statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of programming is that once you have a complete set of instructions for the computer, it will always perform those isntructions correctly.  For that reason, we will want to write our programs to be general enough to work in different situations, reducing our future efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also is important to maintain a working program as is, so that our results can be reproduced when needed.\n"

    "#### The Outline of a Simple Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing an essay, you probably would start with an outline. You should do exactly the same thing with a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to think of programs as a series of tasks that need to be performed.  At the most basic level, the tasks would be to \n",
    "* Read in data (which could be text);\n",
    "* Perform some analysis on the data;\n",
    "* Report the results of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course the outline could be much more detailed.  For example, the data may need to be _preprocessed_ before you can perform an analysis on it.  There also may be multiple types of analysis that you want to perform.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this would work.  Suppose I have a text file, called **emma_chapter_one.txt**, that has the first chapter of _Emma_ by Jane Austen, and I want to know how many times the name \"Emma\" appears in the chapter.  The outline for my program could be as follows: \n",
    "* Read the file **emma_chapter_one.txt**;\n",
    "* Count the number of times the name \"Emma\" appears in the chapter;\n",
    "* Display the results to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to learn some Python to be able to perform these steps."

    "### 2.2  Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variable Overview\n",
    "In any programming language a **variable** is used to store information, including\n",
    "* Data\n",
    "* Results from computations\n",
    "* Words (In either single or double quotes)\n",
    "* Images\n",
    "* Others\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, a variable represents a *_memory location_*, but we can think of it as a label for the information that we used in our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are created by assigning a value to them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "n = 10\n",
    "x = 2.5\n",
    "ans = \"You are correct\" ```\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue>---------------------------------------------------------------</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variable Names\n",
    "\n",
    "As the writer, you may choose the names of your variables, with a few restrictions:\n",
    "*  Variables must start with a letter, or underscore ( _ );\n",
    "*  Variables may not contain spaces;\n",
    "*  Variables cannot be words that are used in the Python language (e.g., if, for);\n",
    "*  Variables are case sensitive (e.g., myVariable is not the same as Myvariable or MyVariable)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**:  It is important to watch out for typos in variable names.  Typos can make the difference betweeen correct code and code with serious problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue>---------------------------------------------------------------</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assignment Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "An assignment statement is a command that will `assign` a value (or values) to a variable.\n",
    "An assignment statement has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```variable = expression```\n",
    "    \n",
    "where `expression` can be a numeric value, a string, an algebraic expression, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Examples:\n",
    "   count = 12\n",
    "   \n",
    "   X = 3.14159\n",
    "   \n",
    "   speech = \"Four score and seven years ago ...\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "   area = length*width\n",
    "   \n",
    "   size = size + 2\n",
    "   \n",
    "<font color=blue>---------------------------------------------------------------</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Closer Look as Assignment Statements\n",
    "Consider the statement:\n",
    "```size = size + 2```\n",
    "\n",
    "In math, this would be an illegal expression -- there is no value that is equal to two more than itself.\n",
    "In programming, this is a legal statement because it is an *_assignment_*, not an equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In an assignment statement, the expression on the right-hand-side (`size + 2` ) is evaluated first, then assigned to the variable on the left-hand-side.\n",
    "* If any variables exist in the expression on the right-hand-side, these variables must have a value assigned to them BEFORE they can be used in the statement.\n",

    "### 2.4. Reading a Text FileÂ¶\n",
    "Another way to get information into a program is to read the contents of a file. The technique for doing this will depend on the format of the file (e.g., is it a plain text file, or a comma-delimited file, or a pdf file).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a plain text file. To read a text file, you first will need to set up a connection to the file. This connection is created with the open function. Traditionally, there are three steps to reading a files: open a connection, read the file contents and save to a variable, and close the connection. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "file_connection = open('emma_chapter_one.txt')\n",
    "text = file_connection.read()\n",
    "file_connection.close()\n",

    "      text = file_connection.read()\n",
    "```\n",

    "      text = f.read()\n",
